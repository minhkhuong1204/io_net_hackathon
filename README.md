### Content for File

#### Video Structure (2–5 Minutes)
Your video should be concise, engaging, and structured to cover the requirements. Here’s a suggested outline:

**Introduction (30 seconds)**  
- Greet the audience and introduce yourself (e.g., “Hi, I’m [Your Name], a participant in the io.net Launch Hackathon Beginner Track!”).  
- Briefly state the purpose: “I’ll explain how the Agentic Workflow Editor works and share my ideas for building AI workflows.”  
- Mention your excitement about the no-code interface and its potential.

**Explanation of Agentic Workflow Editor (1.5–2 minutes)**  
- **What is the Agentic Workflow Editor?** Describe it as a visual, no-code tool for creating AI workflows with Agents, Models, Tasks, and Tools.  
- **How it Works**:  
  - Show the interface (e.g., share your screen or use screenshots from the io.net Dashboard):  
    - **Left Sidebar**: Highlight the workflow list, “+ Flow” button, and search functionality.  
    - **Center Editor**: Explain drag-and-drop components and connections (e.g., Agent → Model → Tool).  
    - **Right Sidebar**: Show how to configure components (e.g., selecting an AI model or setting Task parameters).  
    - **Bottom Panel**: Mention the Flow Outcome for reviewing logs and debugging.  
  - Walk through the workflow creation process (use the doc’s recommended order):  
    1. Add an Agent and configure its name/instructions.  
    2. Connect an AI Model for reasoning.  
    3. Add Tasks for specific actions.  
    4. Integrate Tools (e.g., RAG search or crypto data).  
    5. Run the flow and check results.  
  - Emphasize ease of use: “No coding needed, and it autosaves! You can even export workflows as YAML for sharing.”  
- **Key Features**: Highlight modularity, real-time execution logs, and support for beginners via templates/docs.

**Creative Ideas for Workflows (1.5–2 minutes)**  
- Present 1–2 project ideas you could build with the Agentic Workflow Editor, tailored to real-world applications. Below are two beginner-friendly ideas inspired by the doc’s examples and tools:  
  1. **Crypto Price Monitoring Agent**  
     - **Purpose**: An AI agent that monitors real-time cryptocurrency prices and alerts users when a coin hits a target price.  
     - **Workflow**:  
       - **Agent**: Configured to monitor crypto market trends.  
       - **AI Model**: Use an open-source model to analyze price data and make predictions.  
       - **Tasks**: Retrieve real-time data (using “get coin quotes” Tool), compare against user-set thresholds, and send alerts.  
       - **Tool**: Connect to “get coin quotes” for real-time price data and “search the web” for market news.  
       - **Outcome**: Alerts users via a notification system (e.g., email or Discord) when conditions are met.  
     - **Why Creative?** Combines real-time data with user-friendly automation, relevant for crypto enthusiasts.  
  2. **Research Automation Assistant**  
     - **Purpose**: An agent that automates web research for a given topic (e.g., AI trends) and summarizes findings.  
     - **Workflow**:  
       - **Agent**: Configured to gather and summarize information.  
       - **AI Model**: Select a model for natural language processing and summarization.  
       - **Tasks**: Perform a web search (using “search the web” Tool), extract key points, and generate a summary.  
       - **Tool**: Use “r2r.rag search” for document retrieval and “search the web” for real-time data.  
       - **Outcome**: Outputs a concise report in the Flow Outcome panel or exports it as a document.  
     - **Why Creative?** Simplifies research for students, professionals, or consultants, saving time.  
- Explain why these ideas suit the Agentic Workflow Editor: “The no-code interface makes it easy to connect models and tools, and the modular design lets me reuse workflows for different topics or coins.”

**Conclusion (30 seconds)**  
- Recap: “The Agentic Workflow Editor is a powerful, beginner-friendly tool for building AI workflows without coding. I’m excited to use it for projects like crypto monitoring or research automation.”  
- Call to action: “I hope my ideas inspire you to explore the Agentic Workflow Editor’s potential! Check out io.net for more.”  
- Thank the hackathon organizers and invite feedback.

#### Sample Script (3 Minutes)
*Start recording with a smile and clear voice.*

“Hi, I’m [Your Name], and I’m thrilled to join the io.net Launch Hackathon Beginner Track! Today, I’ll explain how the Agentic Workflow Editor works and share my ideas for AI workflows.

The Agentic Workflow Editor is a no-code tool that lets you build AI workflows by dragging and dropping components in a browser. It’s perfect for beginners like me because it’s visual, autosaves, and comes with templates. Let me show you how it works.

[Screen share or show screenshot] In the Left Sidebar, you can create or search for workflows. The Center Editor is where the magic happens—you drag components like Agents, Models, and Tools to build your flow. For example, I’d start by adding an Agent, give it a name and instructions, then connect it to an AI Model for reasoning. Next, I’d add Tasks for specific actions and Tools like ‘get coin quotes’ for crypto data. The Right Sidebar lets me configure each component, like picking a model or setting task details. When I hit Run, the Flow Outcome panel shows logs to check if it worked or needs fixes. It’s so easy—no coding required!

Now, my idea: a Crypto Price Monitoring Agent. I’d use an Agent to track cryptocurrency prices, connect it to an AI Model to analyze trends, and use the ‘get coin quotes’ Tool for real-time data. A Task would check if prices hit my target, then send an alert. This could help traders stay updated without manual checks. Another idea is a Research Automation Assistant. It uses the ‘r2r.rag search’ Tool to find articles and the ‘search the web’ Tool for news, then summarizes them into a report. This could save hours for students or professionals.

I love how the Agentic Workflow Editor’s modular design lets me reuse these workflows for different coins or topics. The Flow Outcome panel and Discord support make debugging easy, even for beginners.

Thanks to io.net for this amazing opportunity! I’m excited to keep exploring the Agentic Workflow Editor. Check it out at io.net, and let me know what you think of my ideas!”
